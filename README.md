# python-poetry-analysis
I analyzed three months of poems and daily activities with Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Textblob, Statsmodels, and Sklearn.

I wrote my poems from the beginning of August 2021 until November 2021. Not only did I write down the words of my poems but I also recorded some data around the day that I was writing it.


·      How was the weather?

·      Did I eat healthy?

·      Did I listen to music? Which genre?

·      Did I read a book? Which category of book?

·      How long did I meditate?


In my analysis I was looking for correlations between weather, my eating, listening, reading and meditation habits and the wordcount of my poems that day.

I conducted exploratory data analysis, text analysis, regression analysis, cluster analysis and time series analysis in Python with Jupyter Notebook.
